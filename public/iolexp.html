<h1>Client Demand and Thinking Process</h1>
<hr>
<p>Working with clients who do not have a clear idea of what they want to represent their product , service , or business can be challenging for designers. However, the gentleman from Dr. N.K. Chaurasia Memorial IOL Center had a detailed idea of what the organisation wanted, which was refreshing. It was difficult for me to align with the client's frequency in the first meeting, but this interaction was insightful. It highlighted that having a client with a clear demand allows designers to tap into their artistic side as well as a client who leaves the thinking to the designer. <p>This project served as a comprehensive course on artistic mindset because the client knew exactly what they wanted and didn't want any deviation from their demand. Nonetheless, they were open to creative input, considering my advice where it mattered but sticking to their requirements where they didn't resonate with my ideas. With tremendous effort, I was able to deliver. This experience was remarkable and taught me that limitations can enhance creativity, as we must work within predefined boundaries while expressing our skills and artistry.</p>

<p>The client wanted an Intraocular lens with an image of India on the globe , occupying its surface housed between two curved feathers pointing un opposite directions</p>
<p>Here comes the tricky part , they wanted all of this to resemble the human eye.</p>
<p>Hope you liked this project !</p>
